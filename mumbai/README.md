## Restaurant Analysis & Finder - Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Info/Reviews on TripAdvisor (UK)

### Description
* Built a web crawler using Scrapy to collect restaurant information and reviews from TripAdvisor.
* Stored all the data in MongoDB after preprocessing/cleaning the reviews and other restaurant related information.
* Conducted data pre-processing and cleaning by removing stop words, punctuation, special characters, numbers, and white-spaces from reviews.
* Performed tokenization and stemming of reviews, and built a corpus out of it.
* Identified features of the restaurants from the reviews that customers had written using data mining and natural language processing.
* For each feature, opinion sentences were identified and categorized as positive or negative using the WordNet database.
* Produced a summary of the restaurant features based on the discovered information.
* Performed analysis and created intelligent dashboards using Tableau to discover top restaurants by positive and negative reviews, number of restaurants offering a specific cuisine, number of restaurants offering a specific feature/meal, number of restaurants by price category, top restaurants based on location, etc.
* Built a Flask application for users to search for restaurants based on their preferences â€“ the application displays a feature based summary of reviews for the searched restaurant and provides restaurant statistics by city along with other key information.
