99 pancakes,Fort,ambience,"One of the many trending places in recent times ! Had bookmarked it a long time ago ! Visited the Chembur outlet last week with high expectations ! The outlet is quite small and the ambience is pretty simple but has a good vibe to it.Coming to the menu - they provide a decent variety of pancakes and also some extras like Snowflakes ( icecream ) and shakes ! ! Being a nutella lover , it was a no-brainer to order the 'Holla Nutella ' pancakes and this being the strawberry season we also ordered a portion of 'Red Riding Hood ' which has strawberries and nutella ! Holla Nutella was fantasticGood amount of nutella with some sugar topings on the hot pancakes ! Easily a must have here.Red Riding Hood was decent , a bit too sweet for my liking coz of the strawberry and the whipped cream ! We also tried 2 shakes here - Magical Strawberry & Crazy Nutella ! Both of them looked amazingThe presentation was on point ! The strawberry shake takes you straight to Mahabaleshwar ♥️Fresh berries with whipped cream ! Also there were a few strawberry bubbles in the shakeCould not complainThe chocolate shake was amazing too ! Neither too thick nor to watery ! It was just about perfect ! Also tried a different kind of pancake there - the French one which was 'Indulge in chocolate '",-1
